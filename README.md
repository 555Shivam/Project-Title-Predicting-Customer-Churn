# Project-Title-Predicting-Customer-Churn
Customer Churn Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn can help businesses take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle (provide link if available). It includes various features related to customers, such as demographic information, usage patterns, and the churn status (target variable).

Tools and Libraries
Python: Programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
Google Colab: Cloud-based environment for running Python code.
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit, SHAP for data manipulation, modeling, web application development, and model interpretation.

Project Structure
Data Preparation: Loading data, handling missing values, feature engineering, and data scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and insights.
Model Development: Implementing baseline and advanced machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
Deployment: Creating a REST API with Flask or FastAPI and a simple web application using Streamlit for model prediction.
Results Presentation: Visualizing key findings and recommendations for stakeholders.

Usage
Setup
Clone the repository or download the project files from GitHub.
Open the notebook (Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb) in Google Colab.

Running the Notebook
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to load data, preprocess it, perform EDA, train models, evaluate them, and interpret model results.
Ensure all necessary libraries are installed (pip install ...).


Deployment
For model deployment:

Use Flask or FastAPI to create a REST API (app.py).
Use Streamlit to develop a web application (app.py).
Deploy the Flask/FastAPI app on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku) and make it publicly accessible.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to predicting customer churn using Python, leveraging machine learning models and web development frameworks. It provides insights into customer behavior and enables proactive business strategies to reduce churn and enhance customer retention.
